## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)
- MongoDB (v4.0.0 or later)

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suiisharma/shram-fullstack-assignment.git
   cd shram-fullstack-assignment
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/memory_master
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   NODE_ENV=development
   frontend_url=http://localhost:5173
   ```
   Replace `your_jwt_secret_key` with a secure random string.

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

   Open the `App.js` file and update the `REACT_APP_API_URL`:
   ```javascript
   const REACT_APP_API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm start
   ```

5. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to play the game!
